As of May 23, this code is not being used. This repo started as kind of a sketch pad for myself and grew from there. Now that we are nearing deployment, I have set up another repo that is actually for deployment and production. This will be connected to the new repository via the Bonsai Bid organization, but I have left this up for presentation purposes. I will try to get this connected to the production repo by the end of June

## :closed_book: Abstract

Bonsai Bid is a simple, yet powerful online auction platform dedicated to serving the national community of bonsai enthusiasts. Inspired by the bustling, yet inefficient bonsai trading within private Facebook groups, Bonsai Bid is designed to streamline and elevate the buying and selling experience. Our mission is to create a user-friendly, bonsai-specific marketplace that produces unparalleled experiences for both the buyer and seller.
